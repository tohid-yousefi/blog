Are we a little scared when you say math? Yes, I think we are afraid. It has to be something from childhood. I remember there was enthusiasm and festivity at school during sports hours, but I guess everyone was sad in math class. But why? <br />


In fact, I discovered the solution to the problem years later. Intuitive Learning, or rather Intuitive Teaching, and teaching enough. what does that mean now?<br />


Intuitive Learning or Intuitive Teaching is learning or teaching by simplifying the subject. For example, we want to explain what the derivative is and the student will have heard this concept for the first time. Derivative: "It is the tangent value of the positive angle made by any tangent to any curve with the x-axis, which, although generalized for functions on other number sets, is defined primarily for functions with real values, that is, for functions with one variable going from real numbers to real numbers".<br />


but what if we express the derivative briefly and concisely as follows? Derivative: "The derivative is the amount of change of one thing with respect to another thing. That is, the derivative is used to measure the change." I am sure that this simple sentence fits more comfortably in everyone's minds. this is called intuitive teaching and intuitive learning.<br />


the second solution I discovered :) is to teaching enough. So what does that mean? Not everyone needs a good knowledge of mathematics. Not everyone is a mathematician. therefore, it is necessary to teach and learn as much as everyone needs.<br />


What is the relationship between data science and mathematics now? It's like the relationship between omelette and oil. not without someone. but enough is needed. Let's say someone is going to be a data scientist, it doesn't matter if they have a good command of mathematics. Just general knowledge will suffice. <br />


as a result, intuitive learning and teaching as well as enough math will give you enough in data science.
