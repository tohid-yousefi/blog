11 years ago, when I was 18 years old, I chose the computer engineering department as my university preference. At that time, mostly web software was very popular and we were following that market with excitement. however, I was reviewing artificial intelligence articles, even if they were small. I didn't understand too much when I was reviewing those articles. but I liked it very much and it seemed to me that I was going to head towards this field. Anyway, I finished university as a web developer and we went to the market. I worked in the market, but the programs that were written did not satisfy me. I was more after the excitement and wanted to try and design what I saw in artificial intelligence. At least I wanted to guess. Speaking of prediction, it's a term I really like. What a wonderful thing to guide people and the future. <br />

Anyway, let's not get away from the subject... I started to follow my dream and I saw a master's program by chance and enrolled. Intelligent systems engineering department. I started to study that department with great enthusiasm and wrote my master's thesis and graduated. but still, I didn't get what I wanted. I wanted to deal with artificial intelligence and data. where is this data? <br />

Anyway, while I was disappointed again, I saw this article somewhere: data is the oil of the future. lightning flashed in my mind. I said to myself, if data is oil, I need to get oil out of the ground. that is, with my own hands. This will be entirely my own effort, not with a school or graduate program, and I have to read and learn the sources myself. I have been reading ever since and I believe that data is really the oil of the future.
